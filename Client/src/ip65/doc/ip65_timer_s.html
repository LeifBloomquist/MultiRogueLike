 the timer should be a 16-bit counter that's incremented by about
 1000 units per second. it doesn't have to be particularly accurate,
 if you're working with e.g. a 60 Hz VBLANK IRQ, adding 17 to the
 counter every frame would be just fine.

 this is generic timer routines, machine specific code goes in drivers/&lt;machinename&gt;timer.s
