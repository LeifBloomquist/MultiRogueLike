; Installation & Configuration             
;==============================================================

UltrafontPC does not require installation or other files to run.
It will run standalone from wherever it is located once 'unzipped'
to your folder of choice. However, an installer is also provided
that will install UltrafontPC to your Windows programs folder,
sitting happily alongside it's companion application, CartographPC.

On first run, a file (ufpc.ini) will be created which remembers
your preferences for windows size, location, zoom size, etc.

If this file is deleted, it will be re-created next run.

* ufpc.exe (the main program, x86 or x64)
* changelog.txt. (list of changes in different versions)
* readme.txt (this file)
* known-bugs.txt (list of known bugs)
* examples (a folder of charsets to experiment with)
* ufpc-help.chm (help file)
* c64_keyboard.png (image of C64 keyboard map)

UltrafontPC will NEVER support multicolour char editing, so
please don't ask!

For multicolour editing, please pester AuMTRroN into
finishing VICzen (we want it too).
