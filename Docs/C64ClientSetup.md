# Commodore 64 Client Setup Instructions 

*RR-Net or 64NIC+ Required*

1. Download the client PRG from [here](https://bit.ly/2oC9L9M)

2. Write the PRG to a real floppy using ZoomFloppy etc, use a sd2iec/uIEC, or copy the file to another storage device (IDE64, etc)

3. Run the game (**LOAD "ROGUEBOOT",8** then **RUN**), choose a username, and note the IP address it gives you through DHCP

4. **_Forward UDP Port 3000 to that IP Address in your Router._** If your Router allows it, it's helpful to set it up to always reserve the same IP address for your C64. The MAC address is 00-80-10-00-51-01

5. (You may need to re-run the game)

6. Have fun and explore! The good stuff starts on the second level...
