# Ultimate 64 Client Setup Instructions 

*This version is specific to the [Ultimate 64 or 1541 Ultimate-II+ cartridge from Gideon's Logic](https://ultimate64.com/).* 

1. Download the client PRG from [here](https://bit.ly/33ePtce)

2. **The U64 must be configured to have no virtual cartridges attached.**  

3. Configure the U64 network settings as usual, DHCP is fine.

4. Setting the virtual CPU to > 1 MHz will download the game faster but gives no other advantage :-)

5. Write the client PRG to the Ultimate 64.  It is standalone, it can be run from the main filesystem or inside a D64.

6. Run the PRG from the Ultimate 64 File menu

7. Have fun and explore! The good stuff starts on the second level...
