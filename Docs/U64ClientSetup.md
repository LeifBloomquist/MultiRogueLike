# Ultimate 64 Client Setup Instructions 

*This version is specific to the [Ultimate 64 or 1541 Ultimate-II+ cartridge from Gideon's Logic](https://ultimate64.com/).* 

1. Download the client **u64-rogueboot.prg** file from [here](https://bit.ly/33ePtce)  

2. Write the client to the Ultimate 64.  It is standalone, it can be run from the main filesystem or inside a D64.

3. **The U64/UII+ must be configured to have no virtual cartridges attached.**  

4. **The Ultimate Command Interface must be Enabled.**  

5. Configure the U64 network settings as usual, DHCP is fine.

6. Setting the virtual CPU to 48 MHz will download the game faster and make the network inferface slightly more responsive.

7. Run the **u64-rogueboot.prg** file from the Ultimate 64 File menu.  It will download the rest of the game and start automatically.  Login when prompted.

8. Have fun and explore! The good stuff starts on the second level...
