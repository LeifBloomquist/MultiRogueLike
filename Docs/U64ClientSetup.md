# Ultimate 64 Client Setup Instructions 

*This version is specific to the [Ultimate 64 or 1541 Ultimate-II+ cartridge from Gideon's Logic](https://ultimate64.com/). or the [Commodore 64 Ultimate](https://www.commodore.net/category/all-products) (all editions) from the new Commodore.* 

1. Download the client **u64-rogueboot.prg** file from [here](https://github.com/LeifBloomquist/MultiRogueLike/blob/master/Client/Ultimate64/target/u64-rogueboot.prg?raw=true)

2. Transfer the client to the Ultimate 64 (using USB/FTP/etc).  It is standalone, it can be run from the main filesystem or inside a D64.

3. **The U64/UII+ must be configured as follows:**
    * Firmware 3.11 or higher
    * Ethernet connection (Wi-Fi may work but not extensively tested)
    * The Ultimate Command Interface must be Enabled. 
    * No virtual cartridges attached.
    * Network settings as usual, DHCP is fine. 
    * Set Turbo Control to Manual and at least 20 MHz.

    **It's recommended to Save this configuration (via F5 menu) for future use.**

4. Load the above configuration, then run the **u64-rogueboot.prg** file from the Ultimate 64 File menu.  It will download the rest of the game and start automatically.  Login when prompted.

5. Have fun and explore! The good stuff starts on the second level...
