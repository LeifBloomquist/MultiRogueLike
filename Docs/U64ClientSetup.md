# Ultimate 64 Client Setup Instructions 

*This version is specific to the [Ultimate 64 from Gideon's Logic](https://ultimate64.com/).  It has not been tested on a 1541 Ultimate I/II, but may work.*

1. Download the client PRG from [here](https://bit.ly/2oC9L9M)

2. **The U64 must be configured to have no virtual cartridges attached.**  

3. Setting the virtual CPU to > 1 MHz will download the game faster but gives no other advantage :-)

4. Write the client PRG to the Ultimate 64.  It is standalone, it can be run from the main filesystem or inside a D64.

5. Run the PRG from the Ultimate 64 File menu

6. Have fun and explore! The good stuff starts on the second level...
